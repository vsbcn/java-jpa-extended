- Native SQL allow to use more enhaced statements and not method defined.
- Supports only a small subset of the SQL standard, and it also does not support database-specific features. SQL queries can be used for advanced queries.
- The entities can have multiple purposes"... which I've seen in production and I'd say is encouraged by ORM. 
- So much for cohesion and the single responsibility principal. Adding behaviours to database entities is asking for trouble.
- JPA does tend to get in the way by adding layers between your application and the database. 
- If the application requires you to extensively hand-optimize the native database queries and schemas to maximize performance, JPA is probably not a good fit.
